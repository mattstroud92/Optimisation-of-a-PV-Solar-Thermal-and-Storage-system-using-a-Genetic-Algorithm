	Abstract = {In this study, the thermo-economic optimization analysis to determinate economically optimal dimensions of collector area and storage volume in domestic solar heating systems with seasonal storage is presented. For this purpose, a formulation based on the simplified P1 and P2 method is developed and solved by using MATLAB optimization Toolbox for five climatically different locations of Turkey. The results showed that the required optimum collector area in Adana (37$\,^{\circ}$N) for reaching maximum savings is 36m2/house and 65m2/house in Erzurum (39$\,^{\circ}$N) for same storage volume (1000m3). The effects of collector efficiency on solar fraction and savings are investigated. The simulation results showed that the solar fraction and savings of the selective flat plate collector systems are higher than the other black paint flat plate collector systems.},

	Abstract = {A sizing multi-objective optimisation using the genetic algorithm is performed on a solar-hydrogen combined heat and power system integrated with solar-thermal collectors (SH CHP-ST) to supply both power and heat (i.e. hot water demand) to an application. A solar-hydrogen system is a renewable system with hydrogen-based storage consisting of an electrolyser, a hydrogen tank, and a fuel cell. The fuel cell generates heat while producing power that can be recovered. The heat collected from the fuel cell can be integrated with the heat supply of a renewable solar-thermal system consisting of an evacuated tube collector and a hot water storage tank. A simulation module to model the operation of the whole system is implemented in MATLAB. Energy demands and meteorological data for a remote household located in southeast Australia are considered. The sizes of the main components of the system are optimised with the objectives of maximising the overall reliability of the system, minimising the levelised cost of energy, and minimising the percentage of excess energy from the PV that is not utilised. The results show that the electric reliability of the optimal solutions in favour is always equal to 100%. The maximum thermal reliability that could be obtained is around 96%. A trade-off between the cost of energy and percentage of wasted power from PV is found.},

@article{EVINS2014387,
	Abstract = {We present new formulations of the `energy hub' model and evaluate their performance. The energy hub model consists of a mixed-integer linear programming problem that balances energy demand and supply between multiple energy carriers by determining the optimal conversion and storage schedule within certain constraints. The new formulations extend the model to account for performance constraints concerning system efficiencies, storage losses and operating limits. Each formulation allows a more accurate representation of real plant performance to be included in the optimisation, giving more accurate optimised schedules and carbon emissions totals. The first major innovation is a means of limiting the number of state changes (startups or shutdowns). This is achieved by specifying a minimum time for which the plant must operate once it is running. The second innovation is the use of stepwise approximations of efficiency curves, thus allowing part-load behaviour to be accurately simulated using a linear model. The third innovation adds a storage loss term that is a percentage of the current amount stored, rather than a fixed value. The new formulations are demonstrated in an example case, where the impact on the optimal schedule is observed. They are also analysed for each week of the heating season, and their impact on the time taken to find the optimal solution is also discussed. Overall changes in the predicted carbon emissions of up to 22% were found, highlighting the importance of accurate plant representation in energy hub models.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic simulation using Monte Carlo technique to size a battery to meet dual objectives of demand shift at peak electricity cost times and outage protection in BIPV (building integrated photovoltaic) systems. Both functions require battery storage and the sizing of battery using numerical optimization is popularly used. However, the weather conditions, outage events and demand peaks are not deterministic in nature. Therefore, the sizing of battery storage capacity should also be based on a probabilistic approach. The Monte Carlo simulation is a rigorous method to sizing BIPV system as it takes into account a real building load profiles, the weather information and the local historical outage distribution. The simulation is split into seasonal basis for the analysis of demand shifting and outage events in order to match the seasonal weather conditions and load profiles. Five configurations of PV (photovoltaic) are assessed that cover different areas and orientations. The simulation output includes the predicted PV energy yield, the amount of energy required for demand management and outage event. Therefore, consumers can base sizing decisions on the historical data and local risk of outage statistics and the success rate of meeting the demand shift required. Finally, the economic evaluations together with the sensitivity analysis and the assessment of customers' outage cost are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Photovoltaic systems utilize solar energy to generate electrical energy to meet load demands. Optimal sizing of these systems includes the characterization of solar radiation. Solar radiation at the Earth's surface has random characteristics and has been the focus of various academic studies. The objective of this study was to stochastically analyze parameters involved in the sizing of photovoltaic generators and develop a methodology for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic systems. Energy storage for isolated systems and solar radiation were analyzed stochastically due to their random behavior. For the development of the methodology proposed stochastic analysis were studied including the Markov chain and beta probability density function. The obtained results were compared with those for sizing of stand--alone using from the Sandia method (deterministic), in which the stochastic model presented more reliable values. Both models present advantages and disadvantages, however, the stochastic one is more complex and provides more reliable and realistic results.},

	Abstract = {Hybrid photovoltaic systems (PV-hybrid) use photovoltaic energy combined with other sources of energy, like wind or Diesel. If these hybrid systems are optimally designed, they can be more cost effective and reliable than PV-only systems. However, the design of hybrid systems is complex because of the uncertain renewable energy supplies, load demands and the non-linear characteristics of some components, so the design problem cannot be solved easily by classical optimisation methods. When these methods are not capable of solving the problem satisfactorily, the use of heuristic techniques, such as the Genetic Algorithms, can give better results. The authors have developed the HOGA program (Hybrid Optimisation by Genetic Algorithms), a program that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a PV-Diesel system (sizing and operation control of a PV-Diesel system). The program has been developed in C++. In this paper a PV-Diesel system optimised by HOGA is compared with a stand-alone PV-only system that has been dimensioned using a classical design method based on the available energy under worst-case conditions. In both cases the demand and the solar irradiation are the same. The computational results show the economical advantages of the PV-hybrid system. HOGA is also compared with a commercial program for optimisation of hybrid systems. Furthermore, we show a number of results and conclusions about hybrid systems optimised by HOGA.},

	Abstract = {Public awareness of the need to reduce global warming and the significant increase in the prices of conventional energy sources have encouraged many countries to provide new energy policies that promote the renewable energy applications. Such renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydro based energies, etc. are environment friendly and have potential to be more widely used. Combining these renewable energy sources with back-up units to form a hybrid system can provide a more economic, environment friendly and reliable supply of electricity in all load demand conditions compared to single-use of such systems. One of the most important issues in this type of hybrid system is to optimally size the hybrid system components as sufficient enough to meet all load requirements with possible minimum investment and operating costs. There are many studies about the optimization and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems since the recent popular utilization of renewable energy sources. In this concept, this paper provides a detailed analysis of such optimum sizing approaches in the literature that can make significant contributions to wider renewable energy penetration by enhancing the system applicability in terms of economy.},

Three criteria, primary energy saving (PES), annual total cost saving (ATCS), and carbon dioxide emission reduction (CDER) are selected to evaluate the performance of CCHP system. Based on the energy flow of CCHP system, the capacity and operation of CCHP system are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) so as to maximize the technical, economical and environmental benefits achieved by CCHP system in comparison to separation production system. A numerical example of gas CCHP system for a hotel building in Beijing is given to ascertain the effectiveness of the optimal method. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is presented in order to show how the optimal operation strategy would vary due to the changes of electricity price and gas price.},

Two case studies are analyzed, featuring a partially shaded rooftop and a vertical facade. The PV layouts suggested by the genetic algorithm outperform the conventional configurations by reducing the cost of produced electricity between 6% and 18%. The optimization results also show that layouts with more but shorter PV strings achieve higher energy yields. However, when compared with longer clustered strings in the most sunlit areas of the surfaces, this results in the doubling of costs.},

	Abstract = {In this paper a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to facilitate the design of a solar domestic hot water system. The MILP model does so by optimising the area of roof mounted flat plate solar thermal collectors and the volume of thermal energy storage that are required to minimise the annual capital and operational cost of the overall energy system. A new formulation of the MILP is presented in which the model is decomposed into two sub-modules that are iteratively solved. One module determines the optimal sizing of the solar thermal collectors and storage tank. The other module optimises the hourly energy production of the solar collectors based on the impact that the collector inlet stream temperature has on the collector efficiency. This iterative formulation is compared to both a conventional MILP formulation and a dynamic simulation model to determine if the iterative formulation results in a design tool that is able to accurately represent the dynamic behaviour of a solar domestic hot water system, while maintaining the computational tractability and scalability of the model. The novel iterative MILP formulation is applied to a case study of an apartment building in Rheinfelden, Switzerland. The results indicate that conventional MILP formulations overestimate the amount of energy that solar thermal collectors are able to produce, resulting in an oversizing of the required thermal storage tank. However, the iterative MILP model more accurately predicts the energy production of the solar collector, leading to the more realistic sizing of the component technologies. This result is important when evaluating the financial feasibility of solar thermal collector systems in comparison to other renewable generation technologies, as an overestimation of the generation potential of solar thermal collectors may result in an incorrect assessment of their investment attractiveness.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a general model for the optimization of the energy supply systems of buildings is proposed. The model is based on a general superstructure that allows to include all the existing and future technologies, covering heating, domestic hot water, cooling and electricity. The model is linked to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem that allows the selection of equipment and its operation, enabling the minimization of the annual cost for a set of constraints imposed by the designer, such as a Non-Renewable Primary Energy (NRPE) consumption limit. The model has been applied to a case study consisting of a domestic building located in Bilbao (Northern Spain). 13 different technologies were taken under consideration together with the specific conditions of the Spanish context. Three different objectives were determined: (i) the optimal cost; (ii) the Zero Energy Building (ZEB); and (iii) the ZEB′, an alternative ZEB where the whole electricity consumption is considered for the calculation of the NRPE. The 3 cases were compared and analyzed and, finally, a parametric evaluation was carried out, setting the aspects that limit the feasibility of low energy buildings: economic feasibility and physical constraints such as roof availability for renewables.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a method of integrating decentralized energy systems at neighbourhood scale. The method is based on the energy hub concept, which describes and manages the relation between input and output energy flows and thus can be used to optimise energy consumption. The original energy hub concept is further developed to include decentralized and local energy technologies such as photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power, together with district heating systems, building and district conversion and storage technologies at neighbourhood level. Additionally, input from a building simulation tool for evaluating time-dependent buildings energy demand is included in the method. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate and size urban energy systems according to their energy-autonomy, economic and ecological performance. The advantage is that the energy supply systems and local energy storage systems can be evaluated in a combined way at district scale. The suggested method allows to lower peaks in energy demands of neighbourhoods on the electrical grid and to reduce the overall consumption. The developed method is finally applied on a case study for which future energy scenarios of different implementation scale are suggested. The area is located in a village in the mountains and contains 29 buildings. Suggested scenarios include decentralized and local renewable energy sources and district and small heating networks. Results show a variation of 52--98tons of CO2 emissions, and an energy autonomy between 64% and 92%. In case of CO2 emissions, the best solution is given for a combination of multiple supply technologies and small networks which shows 46% lower emissions than for a scenario with only PV and biomass based systems.},

The purpose is, given the design of a cogeneration system, to determine an operating schedule that minimizes the total operating and maintenance costs minus the revenue due to the electricity sold to the grid, while taking into account time-varying loads, tariffs and ambient conditions. The model considers the simultaneous use of different prime movers (generating electricity and heat), boilers, compression heat pumps and chillers, and absorption chillers to satisfy given electricity, heat and cooling demands. Heat and cooling load can be stored in storage tanks. Units can have one or two operative variables, highly nonlinear performance curves describing their off-design behavior, and limitations or penalizations affecting their start-up/shut-down operations. To exploit the effectiveness of state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) solvers, the resulting Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model is converted into a MILP by appropriate piecewise linear approximation of the nonlinear performance curves. The model, written in the AMPL modeling language, has been tested on several plant test cases. The computational results are discussed in terms of the quality of the solutions, the linearization accuracy and the computational time.},

A numerical example arisen from a case study is proposed with the aim of investigating the economic advantages coming from the adoption of an optimal cogeneration operation strategy. Two different scenario problems exploiting a set of experimental data have been investigated. The former focuses on the comparison between a micro-grid wherein the cooling energy demand coming from final users is neglected and a micro-grid wherein the cooling energy demand is taken into account. The latter assesses the effect of a heat storage properly introduced into the micro-grid, once the cooling energy demand is taken into account.},

	Abstract = {Heating accounts for a large proportion of energy consumption in residential buildings located in cold climate. Solar energy plays an important role in responding to the growing demand of energy as well as dealing with pressing climate change and air pollution issues. Solar energy is featured with low-density and intermittency, therefore an appropriate storage method is required. This paper reports a critical review of existing studies on thermal storage systems that employ various methods. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the most effective methods to store thermal energy, and it can significantly reduce area for solar collector. During the application of PCM, the solid--liquid phase change can be used to store a large quantity of energy where the selection of the PCM is most critical. A numerical study is presented in this study to explore the effectiveness of NH4Al(SO4)2·12H2O as a new inorganic phase change material (PCM). Its characteristics and heat transfer patterns were studied by means of both experiment and simulation. The results show that heat absorption and storage are more efficient when temperature of heat source is 26.5$\,^{\circ}$C greater than the phase transition temperature. According to heat transfer characteristics at both radial and axial directions, it is suggested to set up some small exchangers so that solar energy can be stored unit by unit in practice. Such system is more effective in low density residential buildings.},

Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) is more useful than sensible energy storage due to the high storage capacity per unit volume/mass at nearly constant temperatures. This review presents the previous works on thermal energy storage used for air conditioning systems and the application of phase change materials (PCMs) in different parts of the air conditioning networks, air distribution network, chilled water network, microencapsulated slurries, thermal power and heat rejection of the absorption cooling. Recently, researchers studied the heat transfer enhancement of the thermal energy storage with PCMs because most phase change materials have low thermal conductivity, which causes a long time for charging and discharging process. It is expected that the design of latent heat thermal energy storage will reduce the cost and the volume of air conditioning systems and networks.},

This review presents the principal methods available for seasonal storage of solar thermal energy.

Three operation strategies for the hydrogen storage, namely conventional operation strategy, peak shaving strategy and hybrid operation strategy, are compared under two scenarios based on the pessimistic and optimistic costs. The results indicate that the hybrid operation strategy, which combines the conventional operation strategy and the peak shaving strategy, is advantageous in achieving higher Net Present Value (NPV) and Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR). Hydrogen storage is further compared with battery storage. Under the pessimistic cost scenario, hydrogen storage results in poorer performance in both SSR and NPV.

The models from experimentally determined works were taken from various published sources in order to develop a detailed, validated and generalised model for the proposed integrated system that is hitherto lacking. Thus, the hybrid energy storage system is implemented using ideal electronic switches that ensure solar-PV power is directly utilised for battery charging, and any excess generated PV power can be converted into hydrogen fuel for domestic applications including fuel cell power generation systems. The results indicate that conversion efficiency of the solar-PV module is about 34% at this location, and battery power can satisfy low power loads for relatively longer operating period compared to fuel cell power that can satisfy higher power loads but for a shorter operating time. Apparently, the fuel cell dynamic response was limited due to reactants flow conditions near the electrodes which increase internal resistances. The inverter output waveform however, can be maintained at the standard magnitude and frequency that is required by the load.},

In addition, a single collector tube with only beam irradiation is studied as a simplified model, and the results of the simplified model are compared to those of the collector model to identify the difference between these two models. The performance of a solar collector is affected by the shape of the absorber, incidence angle of solar irradiation, and arrangement of collector tubes. The results obtained from the simplified model are very different from those from the collector model, which considered not only beam and diffuse irradiation but also shade due to adjacent tubes.},

Besides the questions of building integration, selective layer, durability and industrial production, it is essential to study the potential yield of such devices and to optimize the design and sizing of the complete heating system. Simulations were carried out using the TNRSYS program in different European climates. Results show that the absorbers reach appreciable efficiency for domestic water preheating but rather low yields when connected to the space heating circuit. Sensitivity of the quantity of saved energy towards the sizing parameters (absorbance, emissivity, orientation, wind, surface, radiator outlet temperature) was analysed. Based on a large set of simulations, general formulas completed by a European map of constants required by said formulas were established that allow calculating the absorbers yield without running complete simulations. General conclusion is that the best use of fa{\c c}ade absorbers is water preheating in urban (wind-sheltered) environment.},

@article{CHANG20091274,
	Abstract = {In this paper, the Julian dating system is adopted to calculate the Sun's apparent position. Both the sunshine duration and the optimal installation angle of a fixed solar collector are obtained for different time periods and latitudes in the northern hemisphere. To simulate different operating environments, both kinds of radiation flux are considered, i.e. extraterrestrial radiation and the global radiation calculated using an empirical model. The results show that Julian dating system is precise enough to predict the Sun's locus according to analyses of the solar declination and the azimuth and elevation angles. The orientation that a solar collector must be installed at can be roughly estimated by determining the sunshine duration. The majority of the Sun's path lies in the southern sky over a year, and hence the sunshine duration in the southern sky is longer, except for locations with latitudes below 1.5$\,^{\circ}$. The yearly optimal angles are positive (approximately 0.91 and 0.76 multiplied by the latitude for extraterrestrial and global radiation, respectively), for latitudes below 65o. Above this, the curves are flatter, and the differences between the two types of radiation flux become greater. The ratio of the yearly irradiation captured by a collector installed at its yearly optimal angle to that captured by the ground surface increases with latitude, and reaches a maximum of 1.71 and 1.35 near latitudes of 65$\,^{\circ}$ for extraterrestrial and global radiation, respectively. The efficiency of a solar collector decreases when operating in a cloudy environment. The amount of global radiation incident on the ground surface is about 0.51--0.66 times that of extraterrestrial radiation throughout the hemisphere.},
